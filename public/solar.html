                                    <p>Apart from those actions, we commit to penalizing every discriminatory, offensive or inappropriate behavior. To do this properly, we ask you to report any discriminatory action against yourself or your colleagues to HR. Our company will not retaliate against you if you file a complaint or discrimination lawsuit. Any employee who retaliates or discriminates will face disciplinary action.</p>

                                    <li>Invest in development opportunities that help you grow professionally.</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>We have established [annual/ bi-annual/ quarterly] performance reviews. During these reviews, your manager will fill out your performance evaluation report and arrange a meeting with you to discuss it. Through these discussions, managers aim to recognize employees who are good at their jobs, identify areas of improvement and talk about career moves. Pay increases or bonuses are not guaranteed. But, we encourage managers to recommend rewards for their team members when they deserve them. There won’t be any forced ranking or other comparison between employees, as our goal is to help all employees improve and develop their careers.</p>
                                    <p>Instructed all managers to meet with their team members once per week to provide feedback and talk about their work and motivations. This way, you can receive feedback in a timely manner and avoid surprises during your annual/ bi-annual/ quarterly performance review.</p>

                                <p>Please inform your manager that you want to work from home at least two days in advance. You can also set a recurring WFH day per week. If there’s a rare emergency, you may work from home without having received prior approval, but call or email your manager as soon as possible. If they are in a different time-zone, contact HR instead.</p>
                                <p>If there is inclement weather (e.g. a blizzard) please check your email or other communication channels to see if the office is officially closed.

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Verbal warning</li>
                                    <li>Informal meeting with supervisor</li>
                                    <li>Formal reprimand</li>
                                    <li>Formal disciplinary meeting</li>

                                <p>You resign when you voluntarily inform HR or your manager that you will stop working for our company. We also consider you resigned if you don’t come to work for three consecutive days without notice.</p>
                                <p>For efficiency’s sake, and to make sure our workplace runs smoothly, we ask that you give at least two months notice. If you hold a highly specialized or executive position, we ask that you give us at least three month notice.</p>
