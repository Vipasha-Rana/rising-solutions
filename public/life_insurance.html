                                <p>A life insurance policy is a scheme that offers guaranteed financial protection for a specific term against the death of the policyholder. The financial protection offered as the sum assured on death of the life assured is payable to the assigned beneficiary of the life insurance policy. The insurer pays out the promised benefit amount either on the death of the life assured (as mentioned earlier) or at the end of the policy term on the date of maturity.</p>

    <h2 id="benefits">Benefits of Life Insurance Plans</h2>
    <p>The perks of buying a life insurance policy are beyond protecting the policyholder's family in tough times. Undoubtedly, it is a necessity for a breadwinner to safeguard their dependents in case of their unfortunate and untimely demise, accident or physical disabilities that lead to a loss of income. Having said that, there is a long list of other benefits that make it a must-have.</p>
    <p>Sadly, most people are not aware of the many benefits offered by a life plan. All they care about are the death and disability benefits. However, there are plenty of other benefits offered by life policies such as maturity benefits, tax benefits etc.</p>
    <div class="left_fullbanner bannertermredirect" data-category="contextual_banners" data-action="trop banner" data-title="critical"></p>
    <p>Let's take a look at the benefits:</p>
    <ul class="number-listing-box">
    <li class="numbers">
    <h3>Acts as a Loan Collateral</h3>
    <p>Till date, many people don't know that life policies can also be used as loan collateral. Based on the type of the life insurance policy and the surrender value, the policyholder can opt for a loan from a bank or NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Company) as per applicable terms and conditions.<br /> Loan Amount: Generally, the loan amount is a percentage of the surrender value of the life policy and it can go up to 90%. There are few companies that only allow for a loan up to 50 percent of the total premium amount paid by the policyholder.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="numbers">
    <h3>Online Payment Discount</h3>
    <p>Most individuals are unaware of the online payment benefit (the payment mode chosen by an individual drastically affects the premium of the policy). As a matter of fact, an company's administrative costs considerably go down when an individual opts to pay his premiums online.<br /> This is because there is no paperwork-related cost involved. Also, the life insurer is able to save a significant amount on the commission, which they pay to the agents for offline life insurance buying and renewing.<br /> <em>Please Note- This discount varies from company to company.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li class="numbers">
    <h3>Discount as per the Opted Payment Periodicity</h3>
    <p>Almost every life insurer offers various payment periodicities to its policyholders- annual, half-yearly, quarterly or monthly mode.<br /> If a policyholder chooses to pay the policy premium on an annual basis, the company can use it for investment purposes that automatically means more profits and benefits for the company.<br /> Once a policyholder chooses the payment periodicity, this discount is often already included in the premium rate charged by the life insurer.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="numbers">
    <h3>Taking Care of Business</h3>
    <p>There are some life insurers that provide an option for policyholders who own a business. In the case of a policyholder's demise, their business partners can purchase the policyholder’s share without any hassles. In this scenario, the business partner will simply have to sign an agreement with the life insurer and the pay-out received after selling the policyholder's share will be given to their dependents.<br /> However, it's important to understand that the nominee or the dependents of the policyholder won’t get a stake in the company.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="numbers">
    <h3>Tax Benefits</h3>
    <p>For paying a life policy premium, a policyholder is eligible for a tax rebate under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act 1961. Irrespective for oneself, their spouse or their children, the premium paid for parents and in-laws is exempted.<br /> This benefit is offered by all the life insurers - be it private sector life insurers or public sector life insurers.<br /> Additionally, the maturity benefit of life policies also qualifies for tax deductions under Section 10 (10D) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.</p>

        <h2>How Much Life Insurance Cover Do I Need? </h2>
        <p>The market has many insurance products such as the term plans , endowment plans, money back plans and ULIPS’. The tax saving instruments is also opulent and people take insurance for Rs 25 lakh, Rs 1 crore and so on. However, simply picking a random figure is not the way to buy an insurance policy.</p>
        <p>Primarily, it depends upon the age of the person, the number of dependents, liabilities, and so forth. Let us just assume that a person falls between the age bracket of 18-24 years of age and is single and unmarried. This means that he does not have many responsibilities. The financial liability could be a loan or his parents depending upon him. Now under such a situation, a small insurance plan would be bought. In case the person has a good source of income, then he could also opt for large cover as the liabilities will increase once married and there will be additional responsibilities upon the shoulders.</p>
        <p>Now if a person falls between the age bracket of 24-33 years of age then ideally the person will be married and he also needs to protect the interest of his life partner. Such a person should buy the life insurance plan immediately and not delay any further. The life insurance cover will differ across various stages of life. </p>
        <p>The life insurance cover should be such that it covers all outstanding liabilities provides money to your spouse and covers the expenses of children education, marriage, etc. When you choose the cover do calculate the yearly family expenses and your liabilities as well. Now multiply the sum with the number of years you are looking forward to supporting the family.</p>
        <p>The life insurance cover should be enough at any point in time to take care of the family today and tomorrow.</p>
